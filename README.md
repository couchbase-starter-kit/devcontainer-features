# Devcontainer Couchbase Features

🐳 Extra add-in features for
[devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)


## Usage

Just add a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file with a `features` key. It's
very similar to `package.json`'s `dependencies` object, just with the addition
of an `options` object.

📚 Make sure to inspect each feature for feature-specific options!

```json
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/ldoguin/devcontainer-features/couchbase-server": {},
    "ghcr.io/ldoguin/devcontainer-features/couchbase-shell": {}
  }
}
```

Then, after adding your devcontainer config file, you can open it in GitHub
Codespaces, or [open it locally using VS Code]. Be warned some features will
compile things from source code and may take a while!
